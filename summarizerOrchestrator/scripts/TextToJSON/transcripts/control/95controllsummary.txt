Amanda Green contacted [Bank Name]’s Fraud Department after being scammed while purchasing a second-hand gaming console for £350 on Facebook Marketplace. The seller, who appeared genuine with positive reviews, requested payment via bank transfer. After the payment was made, the seller provided a non-functional tracking number and subsequently blocked her.

The advisor confirmed the £350 payment along with an additional unauthorized £15 transaction to the same account, which Ms. Green did not recognize. The advisor flagged both transactions as suspicious, blocked further transfers to the recipient account, and found no additional unauthorized activity. As a precaution, the advisor reset Ms. Green’s online banking credentials.

To recover the funds, the advisor initiated a dispute with the receiving bank and requested Ms. Green provide supporting evidence, such as screenshots of communication and the listing. Ms. Green agreed to email the required documentation. The advisor also recommended reporting the incident to Action Fraud and provided contact details for their assistance.

For future protection, the advisor advised using payment methods that offer buyer protection, such as PayPal Goods and Services, rather than direct bank transfers. They also recommended enabling two-factor authentication, updating passwords, and monitoring her credit report for unusual activity. Detailed instructions and tips on safe online purchasing will be included in a follow-up email.

The advisor summarized the actions taken and next steps, ensuring Ms. Green had no further questions. Ms. Green expressed gratitude and committed to following the recommendations to secure her account and prevent future scams.
