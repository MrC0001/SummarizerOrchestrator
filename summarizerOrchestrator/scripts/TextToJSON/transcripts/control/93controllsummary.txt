Robert Collins contacted [Bank Name]’s Fraud Department after transferring £25,000 to a supposed “secure account” following a phone call from someone claiming to be a police officer. The caller alleged that his account was being used for money laundering and urged him to act quickly to protect his funds. They provided a badge number and instructed him to verify their identity by calling 999, which Mr. Collins now suspects was part of the scam, as the line was kept open.

The advisor investigated and confirmed the £25,000 transfer along with two additional blocked payment attempts. Unauthorized devices linked to Mr. Collins’ account were also detected. Mr. Collins admitted to sharing his online banking login and verification codes with the caller, who used high-pressure tactics to induce fear and compliance.

To secure the account, the advisor immediately blocked further transactions, reset Mr. Collins’ online banking credentials, and flagged the activity for an internal investigation. The advisor advised Mr. Collins to report the scam to Action Fraud and provided their contact information. They also explained that the bank would collaborate with the receiving institution to attempt to recover the funds, though success could not be guaranteed.

For enhanced security, the advisor recommended enabling two-factor authentication, updating all account passwords, and using a password manager. Additional measures included monitoring his credit report for potential misuse of personal details and signing up for a credit monitoring service. The advisor also provided education on recognizing scams, emphasizing that genuine police officers would never request money transfers or security codes and suggesting that all claims be verified through official channels.

Before concluding, the advisor summarized the steps taken, including securing the account, initiating recovery efforts, and providing resources for further action. Mr. Collins expressed gratitude and committed to taking the recommended steps to protect his accounts and prevent future incidents.
