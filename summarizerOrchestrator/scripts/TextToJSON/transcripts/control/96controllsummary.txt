Rebecca Taylor contacted [Bank Name]’s Fraud Department after being scammed by a cryptocurrency investment platform. She explained that she discovered the platform through a social media advertisement, which featured endorsements and testimonials. After depositing an initial £5,000, the platform locked her account and demanded an additional £3,000 for "account verification." She complied but was subsequently unable to access her funds.

The advisor identified two payments totaling £8,000 to the platform and flagged the transactions for investigation. They also detected login attempts from overseas IP addresses, suggesting that her banking credentials had been compromised. Rebecca confirmed that she had shared her online banking login details, believing it was part of the verification process.

To secure the account, the advisor immediately reset her online banking credentials and blocked further unauthorized transactions. They initiated a dispute with the recipient bank to recover the funds and requested that Rebecca provide evidence of her communication with the platform, including emails, messages, and screenshots. The advisor also recommended reporting the incident to Action Fraud for further investigation.

For future security, the advisor suggested enabling two-factor authentication, updating all account passwords, and using a password manager to create secure credentials. They advised Rebecca to monitor her credit report for potential misuse of her personal information and provided guidance on identifying fraudulent investment schemes, emphasizing the dangers of guaranteed profits and high-pressure tactics.

The advisor summarized the actions taken, assured Rebecca that she would receive a follow-up email with further instructions, and ensured she had no additional questions. Rebecca expressed gratitude and committed to taking the recommended steps to recover her funds and secure her accounts.
